I've been looking for a way to challenge myself as well as showcase some of my knowledge to the world. After some thinking, I've decided that I would go ahead and write a book. 

I've been reading a lot about aspect-oriented programming and really like what it provides to enhance object-oriented programming. There isn't a lot of information about this in the PHP community so I figured a book would be a great way to drum up some more interest and help create a larger community around the subject of AOP.

I've already got a sample of the book up on Leanpub. You can check it out at [](http://leanpub.com/aopinphp). Feel free to read it and send me any feedback as far as what you might like to see covered in the rest of the book. I plan on pushing some more updates very soon so expect to see a minimum viable product up and available for purchase in the next few weeks.
