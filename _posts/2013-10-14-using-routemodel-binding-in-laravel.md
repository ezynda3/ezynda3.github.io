As I work more and more with Laravel, I keep running across some really cool time saving tricks. One of those time savers is route/model binding.

Let&#8217;s say that you have the following route setup.

```php
<?php
Route::get('books/{book}', function($book) {
    return Book::find($book);
});
```

That&#8217;s pretty simple right? Basically you point your browser at /books and then pass a book id and then use the &#8216;Book&#8217; model to fetch that book from the database. But say we already decided that the &#8216;books&#8217; route should always be working with the book model and a book should be fetched automatically. Laravel gives us a method for explicitly binding the &#8216;Book&#8217; model to our routes.

```php
<?php
Route::model('book', 'Book');
 
Route::get('books/{book}', function($book) {
    return $book;
});
```

Now Laravel will take the id you pass to the route and automatically fetch it behind the scenes. What if we want to fetch a book by something other than it&#8217;s id? What if we want to access our books using a URI similar to /books/BookTitle? Instead of Route::model we can use Route::bind like this.

```php
<?php
Route::bind('book', function($value, $route) {
    return Book::whereTitle($value);
});
```

This is a really good way to cut down on lines of code and at the same time keep it more readable.
