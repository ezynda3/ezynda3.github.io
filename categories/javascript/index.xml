      <description>Somewhat recently, I was refactoring a project that was having issues uploading and importing large CSV files. I was running into all kinds of issues from timeout errors to memory allocation exceptions. The solution was to break up the import and upload it in chunks. This alone was pretty easy but I also wanted to include the ability to display the progress of the entire import. The problem was, I was using AJAX to upload the data.</description>

      <description>For a lot of HTML forms you really don&amp;rsquo;t need much more than the basic form fields that HTML provides. For some projects however you might need a little more. If you want your users to be able to add some styling, formatting or links you&amp;rsquo;re likely to use a third party editor like CKEditor or TinyMCE. Both of these are fine if you need all of the cool features they provide but sometimes those are overkill.</description>

      <description>While reading about different Javascript frameworks and utilities, I kept running across a design patter or technique called &amp;lsquo;promises&amp;rsquo;. It seems every shiny new Javascript thing utilizes them in some way or another. At first the concept seemed difficult to wrap my head around but eventually it clicked. It isn&amp;rsquo;t really as difficult as I thought.
Javascript as well as other modern languages uses a what are called callback functions. These are functions passed as arguments to other functions and are used to do something with the data that the top level function returns.</description>
