      <description>As I work more and more with Laravel, I keep running across some really cool time saving tricks. One of those time savers is route/model binding.
Let&amp;#8217;s say that you have the following route setup.
&amp;lt;?php Route::get(&#39;books/{book}&#39;, function($book) { return Book::find($book); });  That&amp;#8217;s pretty simple right? Basically you point your browser at /books and then pass a book id and then use the &amp;#8216;Book&amp;#8217; model to fetch that book from the database.</description>

      <description>WordPress is a great CMS (Content Management System) is you want to get a site up and running very quickly. It&amp;#8217;s themable and within the theming framework, WordPress includes the ability to include popular assets like JQuery. All it takes is a simple command.

      <description>There are a lot of things to keep in mind when it comes to web development. Security should be at the top of your list. If you read up on web application security, you&amp;#8217;re probably familiar with cross-site scripting or XSS attacks. XSS attacks can cause serious damage but are really simple to prevent.
If you aren&amp;#8217;t familiar, a XSS vulnerability occurs when your application takes user data and then sends it to the web browser without proper validation.</description>
