      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a way to challenge myself as well as showcase some of my knowledge to the world. After some thinking, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that I would go ahead and write a book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a lot about aspect-oriented programming and really like what it provides to enhance object-oriented programming. There isn&amp;rsquo;t a lot of information about this in the PHP community so I figured a book would be a great way to drum up some more interest and help create a larger community around the subject of AOP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve already got a sample of the book up on Leanpub. You can check it out at &lt;a href=&#34;http://leanpub.com/aopinphp&#34;&gt;http://leanpub.com/aopinphp&lt;/a&gt;. Feel free to read it and send me any feedback as far as what you might like to see covered in the rest of the book. I plan on pushing some more updates very soon so expect to see a minimum viable product up and available for purchase in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
