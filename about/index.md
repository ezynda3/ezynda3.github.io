[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-439 about img-responsive" alt="1375635_10151651355490966_1739625752_n" src="http://www.edzynda.com/media/1375635_10151651355490966_1739625752_n-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" />][1]

I&#8217;m an eight year Air Force veteran with a passion for what makes the Internet tick. I&#8217;ve been dabbling in computer wizardry since I was a kid and have been building things on the web since my freshman year in high school. I now specialize in creating websites and web applications for small to medium businesses. If you&#8217;re looking to have a website built, [send me a message][2] so I can hook you up.

In my spare time I like to cook. I often try to recreate things I see on the Food Network and then make sure to spam my friends with pictures of my creations on Instagram.

I&#8217;m a travel junkie. I&#8217;ve been to around 15 different countries and planning on visiting a lot more. Eventually I would like to get to the point where I can work from anywhere while I get my travel fix.
