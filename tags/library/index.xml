      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of talk about continuous delivery in software development these days. One core concept of continuous delivery is &amp;ldquo;Deploy early and deploy often.&amp;rdquo; Rather than deploy an entire application once it&amp;rsquo;s complete, you should be pushing many small features as they come. There are many benefits to this but it isn&amp;rsquo;t without risk.
Using a software version controll system like git can make working on code in teams easy but can just as easily turn into a nightmare when there are too many active branches from the master branch in the repository.</description>
