      <description>PHP is no doubt a great fit for building web applications but it also has the ability to create powerful command line applications. PHP has had this ability for a long time but recently there has been some excellent work done in order to improve the quality of PHP command line tools. The Symfony\Console component makes it incredibly easy to create a command line application that accepts different arguments and options.</description>

      <description>Recently I needed to add some social media functionality to a project. I needed to be able to post to Twitter and Facebook whenever a user created a new item in the web app. I had never done this before in PHP because normally I would use some sort of plugin in WordPress to do this. Since this was not a WordPress site, I needed to do it by hand. Luckily this isn&amp;#8217;t as hard as you might think.</description>

      <description>There is no shortage of coding frameworks these days. I can&amp;rsquo;t scroll through my twitter and facebook feeds or my favorite dev forums without stumbling upon something new. Like a hungry barracuda, I&amp;rsquo;m instantly attracted to new shiny things. While browsing reddit.com/r/php I came across a mention of a microframework called Silex. Now you may be wondering what a microframework is. I was wondering the same thing, so I took a look at the project&amp;rsquo;s website to figure out for myself.</description>

      <title>Use Laravel&#39;s Eloquent ORM Outside Of Laravel</title>

      <description>Working with databases in Laravel is ridiculously easy thanks to Eloquent. Eloquent allows you to map database tables as simple model objects that include various methods for retrieving and updating the database. While working on other people&amp;rsquo;s code, however, I&amp;rsquo;m usually not lucky enough to be working with something as enjoyable as Laravel. Thankfully Laravel is written in such a way that some of it&amp;rsquo;s key components can be used as stand-alone modules.</description>
