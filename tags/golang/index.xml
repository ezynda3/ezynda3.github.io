      <description>&lt;p&gt;Go is becoming increasingly popular with building web applications. It&amp;rsquo;s fast, lightweight and easy to learn. Another great feature is to compile your applications into a single redistributable binary. A lot of web applications depend on external assets, however. For the application to work you still need to package your css, JavaScript and image files along with the executable. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if we can fix this.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Recently, I wrote an article on how to create a simple chat server using WebSockets and Go. I made the source code available and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple to get the example up and running if you have a basic familiarization with Go. I wanted to see if I could make it easier for people to try out though. For this, I looked to the very popular Docker project.
Docker has been around for quite some time but, I only recently began toying around with it more seriously.</description>
