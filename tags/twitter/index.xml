      <description>Recently I needed to add some social media functionality to a project. I needed to be able to post to Twitter and Facebook whenever a user created a new item in the web app. I had never done this before in PHP because normally I would use some sort of plugin in WordPress to do this. Since this was not a WordPress site, I needed to do it by hand. Luckily this isn&amp;#8217;t as hard as you might think.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first thing we&amp;rsquo;ll need to do is create a default layout. This is the layout that the rest of our views will extend. Let&amp;rsquo;s save it as &amp;lsquo;app/views/layouts/default.blade.php&amp;rsquo;.
&lt;/p&gt;</description>
