      <description>If you&amp;#8217;re discussing object oriented programming in PHP these days, it&amp;#8217;s likely that you&amp;#8217;ve at least heard about such topics as dependency injection or IoC containers. They&amp;#8217;re both pretty useful tools for coding and testing your code. What exactly is an IoC container though? It sounds pretty complicated but it&amp;#8217;s really not.
If you read my earlier post on using repositories in Laravel you might have noticed that when using dependency injection in our __construct method, we didn&amp;#8217;t have to actually instantiate our repository.</description>

      <description>The past couple of days I have been cramming my brain with coding knowledge. I&amp;#8217;m working on a side project that I&amp;#8217;ll likely announce in detail as it gets closer to launch. Since I&amp;#8217;m starting from an empty Laravel project and building it from the ground up, I&amp;#8217;m learning quite a bit about the framework and even some of the new features in PHP 5.4 and above.
One technique I&amp;#8217;m starting to better understand is that of dependency injection.</description>
