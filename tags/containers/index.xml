      <description>Recently, I wrote an article on how to create a simple chat server using WebSockets and Go. I made the source code available and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple to get the example up and running if you have a basic familiarization with Go. I wanted to see if I could make it easier for people to try out though. For this, I looked to the very popular Docker project.
Docker has been around for quite some time but, I only recently began toying around with it more seriously.</description>
