      <description>A lot of web applications include some sort of photo uploading functionality. Whether it&amp;#8217;s allowing a user to upload a personal avatar or to create and manage an entire photo gallery with watermarking features, it&amp;#8217;s somewhat of a pain to code. PHP includes several built-in functions for accomplishing this using the GD library but they&amp;#8217;re cumbersome at best. Luckily someone else feels your pain and has written a class that makes it a snap to work with images.</description>
