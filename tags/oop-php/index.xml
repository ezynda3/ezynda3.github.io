      <description>If you&amp;#8217;re discussing object oriented programming in PHP these days, it&amp;#8217;s likely that you&amp;#8217;ve at least heard about such topics as dependency injection or IoC containers. They&amp;#8217;re both pretty useful tools for coding and testing your code. What exactly is an IoC container though? It sounds pretty complicated but it&amp;#8217;s really not.
If you read my earlier post on using repositories in Laravel you might have noticed that when using dependency injection in our __construct method, we didn&amp;#8217;t have to actually instantiate our repository.</description>
