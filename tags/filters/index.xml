      <description>Every so often I have clients who want me to work on WordPress sites or plugins. I honestly hate working with WordPress. While it&amp;#8217;s one of the most popular CMS products in the world with a massive developer base, I find that anything coded for WordPress tends to follow a tacky and poorly organized form of coding. Coding styles vary wildly from developer to developer and there really is no standard.</description>
