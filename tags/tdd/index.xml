      <description>Some of us have had the pleasure of working with someone else&amp;rsquo;s ancient codebase to either add new features or fix bugs. It&amp;rsquo;s never fun and usually a pain. Because of the design (or lack thereof) of the application, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t lend itself to unit testing. The code is littered with static method calls, objects instantiated inside methods rather than being injected through a constructor, and other elements of poor design.</description>

      <description>The past couple of days I have been cramming my brain with coding knowledge. I&amp;#8217;m working on a side project that I&amp;#8217;ll likely announce in detail as it gets closer to launch. Since I&amp;#8217;m starting from an empty Laravel project and building it from the ground up, I&amp;#8217;m learning quite a bit about the framework and even some of the new features in PHP 5.4 and above.
One technique I&amp;#8217;m starting to better understand is that of dependency injection.</description>
