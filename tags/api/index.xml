      <description>PHP is no doubt a great fit for building web applications but it also has the ability to create powerful command line applications.

      <description>Recently I needed to add some social media functionality to a project. I needed to be able to post to Twitter and Facebook whenever a user created a new item in the web app. I had never done this before in PHP because normally I would use some sort of plugin in WordPress to do this. Since this was not a WordPress site, I needed to do it by hand. Luckily this isn&amp;#8217;t as hard as you might think.</description>
