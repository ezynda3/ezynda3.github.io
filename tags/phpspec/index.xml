      <description>In the first part of this series, I showed you how you can easily set up a project to run automated tests using Jenkins. The quickest and easiest way to build your project and run tests is to add a build step that runs a bunch of shell commands. This is fine for small projects but what about larger projects with complex build steps and dependencies?
A better options is to use another tool to automate the build process and perform certain tasks dynamically.</description>

      <description>Continuous integration or CI, is all the rage these days. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with what CI is, it&amp;rsquo;s basically a methodology for rapidly developing, testing and deploying applications. Using a well configured CI setup or pipeline, a developer or team of developers can make a change to their codebase, test those changes to make sure they didn&amp;rsquo;t break those changes and then push that code live in a matter of minutes.</description>
